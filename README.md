```
composer require griddb/php-client

[GridDB Server](https://github.com/griddb/griddb_nosql) need to be started in advance.

1. Write the following description in /etc/php.ini
```
extension=<PHP client library file directory path>
```
With:

- \<PHP client library file directory path> is [...]/vendor/griddb/php-client/src/griddb_php_client.so


2. In your root project, execute the command to run sample:

```
$ cp vendor/griddb/php-client/sample/sample1.php .
$ php sample1.php <GridDB notification address> <GridDB notification port>
        <GridDB cluster name> <GridDB user> <GridDB password>
      -->Person: name=name02 status=false count=2 lob=ABCDEFGHIJ
```
If you want to run your other sample, remember to add the following line in your sample to include griddb_php_client.php library:
```
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'
```
This make composer load automatically griddb_php_client.php library from **vendor** folder.
